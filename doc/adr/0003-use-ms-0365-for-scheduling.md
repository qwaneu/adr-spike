# 3. Use MS-0365 for scheduling

Date: 2023-11-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Scheduling is a complex task. It involves knowledge of availability of teachers and rooms within the company. Office is already used for scheduling meetings. The administrative employees, are used to the same existing tooling.

## Decision

We use office 365 (outlook calendar in particular) to perform the scheduling tasks.

## Consequences

It makes the schedling task easier to do. Resolving conflicts with other meetings (locations, meeting/class rooms) or teachers is a breeze. 

We will need to interact with office 365. There are api facilities, but it does not look particularly simple. 

We are unsure at the momen whether we still need some sort of UI on our scheduling information, for example for keeping an overview of the complete schedule of curricluae.
